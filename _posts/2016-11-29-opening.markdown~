Hej,

this blog is dedicated mostly to collect some of the programming/computing/other related things I came across during my work and my freetime. You shouldn't expact really huge, breakthrough things rather a modest repository of stuff I wanna lookup sometimes. Nevertheless, I hope, somebody else can find something interesting as well.
