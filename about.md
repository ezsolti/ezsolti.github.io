Hej,

my name is Zsolti, I am something between an applied physicist and a nuclear engineer. I have got my masters in Physics at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 2011. I worked one year at the Hungarian Atomic Energy Research Institute. Then I had started a PhD at Chalmers University (Sweden) in 2012 [(thesis here)](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/publication/242428-neutron-monitoring-based-on-the-higher-order-statistics-of-fission-chamber-signals). Currently I'm working as a postdoc researcher at Uppsala University within the field of nuclear safeguards.

This blog is dedicated mostly to collect some of the programming/computing/other related things I came across during my work and my freetime. You shouldnâ€™t expect really huge, breakthrough things, rather just a modest repository of stuff I wanna lookup sometimes. Nevertheless, I hope, somebody else can find here something interesting as well. Please feel free to contact me.
