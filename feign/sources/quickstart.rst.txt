=============================

Import feign modules
--------------------

The best is to include everything.

.. code-block:: python

   from feign.geometry import *
   from feign.blocks import *


Creating an Experimental setup
------------------------------

In order to create a setup, one needs to describe the materials included in the setup, the fuel pins included in the assembly, and
the assembly itself. Finally, one needs to add detector locations, and optionally absorber elements.
