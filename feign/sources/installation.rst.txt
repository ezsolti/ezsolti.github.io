Installation
============

``feign`` can be installed by downloading the zipball from github.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install https://github.com/ezsolti/feign/zipball/master

Dependencies:

* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Getting data
------------

Mass attenuation coefficients can be obtained from the `XCOM webpage
<https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Xcom/html/xcom1.html>`_, or by downloading the `XCOM software
<https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Xcom/Text/download.html>`_. When creating your own datafiles, do not
forget to include an energy grid which covers your energy region of interest, because ``feign`` is unable to
extrapolate the mass attenuation coefficients. Also try to use a reasonably dense energy grid which can catch the energy
dependence of the mass attenuation coefficient, otherwise the interpolation will not be a decent approximation.

Test data files are also available at `feign's github repo
<https://github.com/ezsolti/feign/tree/master/data>`_. Mass attenuation coefficients are there for some materials common in passive gamma spectroscopy of nuclear fuel (uranium-dioxid, water, air, lead, aluminium, copper, stainless steel). Save these files to your prefarred location and include the paths when creating Material() objects.
