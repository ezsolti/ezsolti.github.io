feign's documentation
=================================

feign is python package, intended to estimate the geometric efficiency in passive gamma spectroscopy measurments of spent nuclear fuel assemblies. a point-kernel method based package intended to estimate the geometric efficiency of fuel in python. 
Therefore, an "uncollided F5 tally" was implemented in python to estimate the geometric efficiency of
fuel assemblies in 2D (ie. in collimated cases). The working title of the code is FEIGN (implying that
the program pretends to be a transport code, however it is not). The user defines the geometry of the
source, which needs to be a rectangular lattice and the positions in the lattice can be filled with coaxial
cylinder elements (eg. fuel pins, cladding). The user also defines the material compositions of these
cells and the detector points where the efficiency needs to be evaluated.
