feign: A python package for passive gamma spectroscopy efficiency
=================================================================

``feign`` is a python package, intended to estimate the geometric efficiency in passive gamma spectroscopy measurments of spent nuclear fuel assemblies. It implements a 2D point-kernel method without build-up factors (ie. an "uncollided F5 tally" for MCNP users). The feign implies that the program pretends to be a transport code, however it is not. 

The user defines the geometry of a rectangular fuel assembly, which is build of pins (nested annular material regions). The user also defines the composition of materials present in the simulation, the detector points where the efficiency needs to be evaluated, and optionally collimators and absorber elements. 

As a package, ``feign`` provides

* basic 2D geometry classes (Point, Segment, Circle, Rectangle)
* classes to describe materials, fuel pins, rectangular fuel assemblies, detectors and absorbers

Below you can find several example notebooks describing how to interact with ``feign``, and how to visualize results.
