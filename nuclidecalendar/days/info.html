 <h1>Nuclear physics is a nutshell</h1>

<h2>Elements, nuclides and isotopes</h2>

<p>You probably all remember the periodic table of the chemical elements from school, if you were lucky you might even saw one every day hanging on the classroom's wall. These chemical elements are substance what we cannot break further by chemical reactions. They are made of tiny atoms having identical number of protons. For example if you had a piece of pure iron (let say 1 kilo, because you don't wanna do heavy lifting just before Christmas), that would be a chemical element, made up of roughly 10000000000000000000000000 atoms. That is 25 zeros there. Now, these atoms consists of a seed, a nucleus and electrons buzzing around it. How these atoms can participate in a chemical reaction (for example to get rust on our iron) is mostly determined by the number of protons within the nucleus. So really, at this level we mostly care about positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.</p>

<p>If you are a pupil now, and your school's periodic tables are up to date, you would observe 118 elements on it: 94 naturally occurs on Earth, and the rest was synthetically created. They are like toys for some scientists. Or maybe the equpments to synthetize these are the toys, and these are more like ice cream.</p>

<p>Life seems quite simple with only having a couple of hundred of these elements, certainly we can even do some chemistry with them, make an omelette and such. But the fun part begins when we realize that the nucleus may have some other particle in it besides protons: the neutrons. That's when we start to talk about nuclides which are atoms characterized by their number of protons, number of neutrons, and energy state (but we will leave the hard core scientists to worry about that one). The particularly interesting thing for us are the isotopes: the variants of a chemical element, so they have the same amount of protons, and the only difference is in the number of neutrons. Let's pick up that lump of iron again, if we examine it a bit closer, we don't just see that it has that huge amount of atoms in it, but we could also see that there are four different type of atoms, differing only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. Now this seemingly subtle difference can make quite big differences when we look into nuclear properties and nuclear reactions. It can affect whether an isotope is stable. For example, breathing some oxygen with eight neutrons is quite a customary habit for most of us, but you probably would like to avoid sipping an oxygen with only seven neutrons, since that is radioactive (we will talk about that in a moment). The fun part is that, as we said before, the chemical properties is mostly determined by the number of protons in an atom, so the various isotopes of the same element participate in chemical reactions in the same way: your lungs will not care whether you are sucking on stable or radioactive oxygen, they will send it around your body anyway.</p>

<p>And with that, our seemingly simple life with 118 elements suddenly expanded to having more than 3000 thousands nuclides (good news: that's a lifetime of nuclide calendars!), and that is the reason why the nuclear physicists also have a nuclide chart on the wall next to their periodic table. Something like what we have below, just physicists tend to overwhelm it with additional details. In this chart small pixels in each row show the known isotopes of a given element (so a neutron and proton number configuration). One can certainly appreciate it as a wall carpet. </p>

<p>But before we get too stressed about the number of possible nuclides, we can calm down a bit, because only a small portion, 339 of of these nuclides are naturally occuring and 252 of them are stable, and only the rest are radioactive. But wait, where do they come from?</p>

<h2>Origin of nuclides and radioactivity</h2>



<p>You might wonder why certain nuclides are radioactive and why certain are not.<p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<p>We are researchers at Uppsala University working at the Division of applied physics. Our research and teaching activity is centered around nuclear reactor physics, nuclear safeguards and radiation measurements. During our work we have to deal with many different nuclides, mostly because spent nuclear fuel is a zoo of them. After a while we grew to appreciate various properties of these nuclides, and the perfectness of nature how the pieces of this puzzle fit together. That is the reason we wanted to you to share our fascination with you.<p>
